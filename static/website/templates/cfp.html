                              <li>Papers are invited on chemical process, modelling, simulation, and optimization. </li>
                              <li>Use of open source software such as DWSIM and OpenModelica will be preferred.</li>
                              <li>Authors must submit the manuscript up to 6 pages of length including tables, figures and references in the required 2-column format as described in the template below.</li>
                              <li>Multiple submissions from one author is allowed.</li>
                              <li>Maximum 3 authors for one paper are allowed, in that case only one author should submit a paper on behalf of everyone. All authors should register and book a ticket for the conference.</li>
                              <li>Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and presentation.</li>
                              <li>Authors should ensure that their work doesnâ€™t contain plagiarized content and not under copyright elsewhere.</li>
                              <li>Please download the appropriate file for structure of the paper.
